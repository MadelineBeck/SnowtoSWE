This is a model to calculate the snow water equivalent out of given snow heights. The model is ported from R
code which was written from Winkler et al. 2020 "Snow Water Equivalents exclusively from Snow Heights and their
temporal Changes: The âˆ† SNOW . MODEL".

The code structure was adapted a bit but the calculations, input and output variables stayed the same.

Ported by Manuel Theurl who is taking no warranties for the correctness of the R to python port.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up

The python code is written in Python 3.6, so for other versions small adaptions may be necessary.

External python modules needed for running the script are
numpy, pandas

A full list of all the required modules (which mostly are installed by default) are included in the requirements.txt file.
